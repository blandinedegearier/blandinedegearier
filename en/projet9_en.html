          <i>19th January 2019, participation in a Hackathon in Marseille initiated by <a href="https://www.ledonut-marseille.com/">Donut infolab</a> association. During 48h, we had to find a numeric solution to fight against unfit housing. Since the collapse of two buildings on November the 5th, this is a big issue in Marseille; 2000 households had to leave their housing because of insecurity. The Hackathon’s participants were in 5 teams each with a different theme, one prototype per team have been done and introduced to a panel of experts at the end of the week-end.

        <b>Description:</b>
         Our team was made of : Benoît Guigal - Data engineer<br>
        Antoine Miceli - Frontend developer<br>
        Blandine - graphic designer<br>
       Our prototype, called Coach Appart, is a web site which made the user able to evaluate the decency of his/her housing according to objective criteria. It will give some suitable recommendations.

<ul>
    <li>Poor housing: Warning</li>
    <li>Indecent housing: Priority work</li>
    <li>Decent housing: Comfort work</li>
    <li>Decent and comfortable housing: asking for a label or rental intermediate</li>
</ul>
       
Following this statement, the web site suggests a connection with local artisans who have the accreditation to solve the problem.
